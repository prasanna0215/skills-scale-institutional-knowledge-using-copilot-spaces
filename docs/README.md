# Project Management Processes at OctoAcme

This documentation provides an overview of the structured project management practices employed at OctoAcme, designed to ensure consistent execution, quality delivery, and rapid knowledge transfer across teams. OctoAcme projects follow a clearly-defined lifecycle: Initiation, Planning, Execution, Release, and Retrospective. Each phase produces lightweight but targeted artifacts—such as a project charter, prioritized backlog, release plan, risk register, and action-oriented retrospectives—that aid in transparency and repeatability. Planning is anchored by a kickoff meeting, a detailed backlog with acceptance criteria, clear estimation, and a mapped timeline of releases and milestones.

Core roles are explicitly assigned for accountability: the Project Manager (PM) manages delivery schedules, risks, and communications; the Product Manager (PdM) owns outcomes and backlog priorities; Developers design, build, test, and deliver features; QA/Testing assures acceptance and release readiness; Stakeholders provide strategic input and approvals. Team communication flows through daily standups, weekly syncs between PM and PdM, regular delivery reviews, and monthly stakeholder updates—helped by status and incident templates centralized in a single, living source of project truth.

Execution is managed through a workflow-driven project board (Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → QA → Done), with PRs kept small and tightly scoped, referencing issues and acceptance criteria. Continuous integration enforces linting and automated tests, and every merge requires at least one approval. Quality assurance is embedded throughout: unit, integration, and end-to-end testing, plus security scanning in CI and manual QA for acceptance when indicated. Pre-release smoke testing and a documented rollback playbook help minimize risk.

Risk management combines ongoing tracking with weekly reviews of a register (impact, likelihood, ownership, mitigation), and escalation is tiered from team to PM to Product Lead/Sponsor. Retrospectives are timeboxed and focused on a handful of impactful improvements, with outcomes tracked as backlog items for further review. This feedback loop ensures OctoAcme’s project management processes continually evolve to support reliable, scalable, and rapid delivery.
